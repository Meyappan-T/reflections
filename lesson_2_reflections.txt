What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

While initializing a repository, a git config folder will get created with a name .git 
Which will be used for tracking the commits and files. Auto commit won't happen.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area will have the files that needs to be committed. Git will keep track of the files once a commit is done.
Working directory files won't get tracked by git.
